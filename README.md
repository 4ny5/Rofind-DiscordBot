# RoFind-RobloxDiscordBot

Rofind is just a bot that looks up users via roblox so if you do
~search Roblox or ~av Roblox it pops up the avatar of the user and 
also the profile of the user.


Now theres 2 files one named "config.json" inside of the config file 
and theres another one named "ChannelID.json" inside of the data file


now the data is for if someone wants to make a feedback about 
the bot then that message will be sent to ur discord server to grab your channel id 
just right click on the channel and it should say "Copy ID" then copy it inside of the "ChannelID.Json"
and then done

For the config.json just go to your developer panel on discord
and make a bot then copy bot token and place it where it says "BotToken" then done
